description: '"Rationalism is the most recent, but not the least violent and insidious,
  of all the developments of skepticism. We purpose to show its historical position,
  and to present, as faithfully as possible, its antagonism to evangelical Christianity.
  The guardians of the interests of the church cannot excuse themselves from effort
  toward the eradication of this error by saying that it is one which will soon decay
  by the force of its natural autumn"--Introduction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)
